Ever since the beginning of my college journey, I have been fascinated by the many revolving niches of software engineering specializations that exist throughout the field of Computer Science. During my freshman year, I had a brief stint with frontend engineering, which fuelled my interest towards the field of backend engineering. Over the semesters, I learned multiple languages and frameworks, including JavaScript and Python, as well as FastAPI and Next.js, respectively.

Now, as a final-year college student, with the pressure around me and my main goal being to land a job in an oversaturated and competitive landscape, gaining exposure and improving my skills are the two most important things that will set me apart from the crowd.

An opportunity to intern as a backend engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad, would serve as a tremendous chance not only to gain experience and industry-relevant skills but also to meet professors and experts, all the while bonding with them and growing as a person.

During my time at IIT, I hope to make use of the various facilities that will be accessible to me. I am especially looking forward to working on big projects with the help of my staff and seniors, who can provide me with sound advice and help me in areas where I am weak. At the end of my journey, I hope that I will be able to walk out with a set of skills unlike the ones I walked in with.
